# Project Horizon
![Horizon-Logo](Horizon-Logo-Dark.png)

**Project Horizon** is a Unity-based multiplayer aerial combat game where players pilot jets to engage in thrilling dogfights over an infinite, procedurally generated terrain. The game combines the traditional Unity GameObject structure for map generation with ECS (Entity Component System) + DOTS (Data-Oriented Technology Stack) for optimized player input and multiplayer networking.

## Features

- **Infinite Terrain Generation:** Procedurally generated environments using GameObject-based systems inspired by traditional Unity workflows.
- **ECS + DOTS Optimization:** Smooth and efficient player movement and networking powered by Unity's ECS and DOTS.
- **Multiplayer Gameplay:** Host public or private games, or join a dedicated server for an engaging multiplayer experience.
- **Single-Player Mode:** Explore the terrain and practice your piloting skills in a private game.
